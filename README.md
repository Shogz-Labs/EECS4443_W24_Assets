### Lab 1 FAQ
1. I'm getting errors when I import Demo_Android! What should I do?
     - Firstly, make sure that you've installed the lab from the right place! You should download the most up-to-date Android apps from [the course GitHub page!](https://github.com/yorku-ease/EECS4443-Demos).
     - If your errors involve the R package, please ensure that you **Sync Project with Gradle Files.**
     - The slogan of debugging in Android Studio is: ``Sync to Project, Rebuild Project, Clean Project, Invalidate Caches, etc., ``
2. How should I be documenting my code? To what extent?
     - Great question, you should be writing Javadoc for your helper methods and single-line and/or block comments for minor edits
     - You should be adding comments in your XML file. These are done by leveraging the following syntax:
       <br>
       ``<!-- This is a comment in your XML file!! ðŸ˜Ž -->``
