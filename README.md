## Frequently Asked Questions / Troubleshooting
### Installing Android Studio (Week 1)
Please refer to the [Week 1 slides](https://github.com/stoyonaga/EECS4443_W24_Assets/blob/main/TA%20Slides/Week%201%20-%20Introduction.pdf) for a comprehensive set of resources and step-by-step instructions. Additionally, I will be able to help you over Slack or during the lab session ðŸ˜„
### Lab 1 FAQ
1. I'm getting errors when I import Demo_Android! What should I do?
     - Firstly, make sure that you've installed the lab from the right place! You should download the most up-to-date Android apps from [the course GitHub page!](https://github.com/yorku-ease/EECS4443-Demos).
     - If your errors involve the R package, please ensure that you **Sync Project with Gradle Files.**
     - The slogan of debugging in Android Studio is: ``Sync to Project, Rebuild Project, Clean Project, Invalidate Caches, etc., ``
2. How should I be documenting my code? To what extent?
     - Great question, you should be writing Javadoc for your helper methods and single-line and/or block comments for minor edits
     - You should be adding comments in your XML file. These are done by leveraging the following syntax:
       <br>
       ``<!-- This is a comment in your XML file!! ðŸ˜Ž -->`` 
### Lab 2 FAQ
1. I'm having trouble interpreting the background requirement. What exactly am I supposed to do?
     - The entire background of the application should be dark blue (or really, any colour of your choice). The point is that it should be one solid gradient.
     - Please refer [here](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/theming/themes) for a hint!
2. My Views in my layout are being cropped when the app transitions from the vertical to horizontal layout!! What should I do!?
     - You will either need to re-arrange the views in your horizontal view or use a [ScrollView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ScrollView). To be specific, you should make the ScrollView the topmost parent that encapsulate the LinearLayout. 
### Lab 3 FAQ
1. Can you explain the Zoom-In? I am a bit confused.
     - The Zoom-In function needs to be contextualized with relation to where you tap on the image. For example, if you tap on the upper right corner, it should expand the image ($\times 3$) and shift it to the left so that the image is centered around the tapped region.
### Lab 4 FAQ
1. How can I keep track of In-Path Time?
     - Try to think of the game logic first. If the ball is in the path, keep a running tab using the [Apache Commons StopWatch object](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/time/StopWatch.html).
     - There are of course other ways to go about doing this such as doing scratchpad arithmetic with with the System [currentTimeMillis()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#currentTimeMillis--) method.
### Lab 5 FAQ
1. I'm just lost in general. Where do I start?
     - I strongly encourage you to take a look at [Demo_GridView](https://github.com/yorku-ease/EECS4443-Demos/tree/main/Demo_GridView). A majority of the code required to complete the lab can be used from here with citation.
     - You can also refer to [Demo_Ink](https://github.com/yorku-ease/EECS4443-Demos/tree/main/Demo_Ink) to figure out how to share the images using the image sharing option.
